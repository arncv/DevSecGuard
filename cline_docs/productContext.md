4. Lack of visibility into repository security health
5. Need for continuous security monitoring

## How It Should Work
1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Users sign in with GitHub OAuth
   - Secure access to repository scanning features

2. **Core Functionality**
   - Repository scanning for security vulnerabilities
   - Detection of exposed secrets and API keys
   - Identification of SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities
   - Historical tracking of security scans
   - Dashboard for monitoring repository health

3. **User Experience**
   - Simple repository URL input for scanning
   - Clear presentation of scan results
   - Historical view of past scans
   - Responsive design for all devices
