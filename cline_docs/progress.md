# Progress Tracking

## What Works
1. âœ… Project Setup
   - Next.js 14 app structure
   - TailwindCSS configuration
   - TypeScript integration
   - ESLint setup

2. âœ… Authentication
   - GitHub OAuth integration
   - Protected routes
   - Session management

3. âœ… Core UI
   - Landing page
   - Dashboard structure
   - Responsive design
   - Navigation components

4. âœ… Security Scanning
   - Secret detection implementation
   - SQL injection pattern matching
   - XSS vulnerability detection
   - Scan results display

5. âœ… History Tracking
   - Scan history storage
   - Results visualization
   - Progress tracking
   - Historical comparisons

## In Progress / Planned
1. ðŸ”„ Enhanced Security Scanning
   - Gitleaks integration for better secret detection
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Additional security patterns
   - Git history scanning

2. ðŸ”„ Improved Results Analysis
   - Severity scoring system
   - False positive detection
   - Result categorization
   - Code context extraction

## Future Improvements
1. [ ] Real-time scanning with webhooks
2. [ ] Custom scanning patterns configuration
3. [ ] CI/CD pipeline integration
4. [ ] Team collaboration features
5. [ ] Expanded vulnerability detection patterns

## Known Issues
- None documented yet

## Next Steps
1. Update `lib/scanner.ts` to include Gitleaks integration
2. Implement dependency vulnerability scanning in `lib/scanner.ts`
3. Add more security patterns to `lib/scanner.ts`
4. Extend Git history scanning in `lib/scanner.ts`
5. Implement a severity scoring system in the scan results processing logic
6. Develop false positive detection mechanisms
7. Categorize scan results in the UI components
8. Extract and display code context for scan findings
